    "    <li>Make sure the volume of OG pipetted into each well matches the volume you specify in the workflow.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The appropriate OG concentration depends on the volume pipetted. A good starting point is a concentration of 1 g/l.</li>\n",
    "    <li>This concentration works well for volumes between 2 and 10 microliters.</li>\n",
    "    <li>If your absorbance values end up below 0.1 or above 1, consider running the test again, but with a higher/lower OG concentration, respectively.</li>\n",
