    DOCUMENTATION FOR THE "i2s_pipacc_instructions.html" FILE:
    This HTML file is the central hub for all instructions used in the Pipetting Performance Workflow. The instructions should be added to the workflow using the "i2s_pipacc_add_instructions.py" transformation. Only the first instruction, which is rendered before loading the instructions, needs to be added manually. The ID of each instructions needs to be unique and shall not be ommitted (causes error in the Python transformation). The ID can be put in the "instruction_text" form field extension using ${example_instruction_id}. Make sure to include an "instruction_title" filled with a space so that the "instruction_text" is rendered.

    FORMAT OF THE INSTRUCTIONS:
    Each instruction needs to be put into a separate <div> element. The <div> needs to contain an ID tag, similar to the following example:
    
    <div id="example instruction">
        <p>Add your instruction text here.</p>
    </div>

    The HTML is correctly rendered in AutoLab as long as only standard HTML functions are used (AutoLab does not support CSS). Make sure to add a <br> between paragraphs, as there is no spacing between paragraphs by default. See the instructions below to get an idea what is possible with AutoLabs way of rendering HTML text.

    ADDING A NEW INSTRUCTION:
    1. Create a new <div> element with a new, unique ID.
    2. Add your instruction using standard HTML elements.
    3. Reference the ID of your new instruction in the Camunda workflow as an "instruction_text".
    4. Enjoy!

        <h2>Welcome to the Pipetting Performance Workflow!</h2>
        <p>This workflow helps you test the pipetting performance of your robot, making sure it works reliably. Here, you can get an overview of it.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>You will be guided through the process of:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Selecting the <b>experiment parameters</b> for the performance test.</li>
            <li>Running the <b>pipetting performance protocol</b> on your liquid handling system.</li>
            <li>Measuring the <b>absorbance</b> on a plate reader.</li>
            <li>Downloading an <b>HTML report</b> of the performance of your pipetting robot.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><br></p>
        <h3>Quick, full or 8-channel run?</h3>
        <p>Based on your needs, you can select one of three run modes.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>The quick run option:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Should only be used for <b>96-channel</b> or <b>384-channel</b> pipetting heads.</li>
            <li>Allows you to quickly fill a single plate with Orange G using your robot.</li>
            <li>Gives a rough overview of the precision of your system using absorbance measurements.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>The full run option:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Should only be used for <b>96-channel</b> or <b>384-channel</b> pipetting heads.</li>
            <li>Should be used if a more precise, quantitative approach is needed.</li>
            <li>Requires at least three plates being measured to assess channel deviations and inter plate variability.</li>
            <li>Includes running an <b>optional gravimetric test</b> to get an overview of the accuracy of the system.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>The 8-channel run option (also for single-channel):</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Should always be used when testing an <b>8-channel</b> pipetting head. Can also be used for testing <b>single-channel</b> pipettes.</li>
            <li>Always uses one plate and 12 replicates, as they all fit on one plate.</li>
            <li>Can assess channel deviations and inter plate variability.</li>
            <li>Allows running an <b>optional gravimetric test</b> to assess the overall accuracy of the system.</li>

        <h3>Running the pipetting protocol on your robot</h3>
        <p>To assess the performance of your system, you need a pipetting protocol for it that pipettes a given amount of water into each well of a microplate and then adds the appropriate amount of Orange G (OG) solution on top of that. Please consider the following points when running such a protocol.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For some liquid handling systems, pipetting scripts are already available. Otherwise, a new script can be written according to the guidelines provided above.</li>
            <li>Make sure you correctly set up your deck according to the instructions of your pipetting script.</li>
            <li>Use Milli-Q water for the water pipetting step and in your OG solution.</li>
            <li>Make sure the volume of OG pipetted into each well matches the volume you specify in the workflow.</li>
            <li>The appropriate OG concentration depends on the volume pipetted. A good starting point is a concentration of 1 g/l.</li>
            <li>This concentration works well for volumes between 2 and 10 microliters.</li>
            <li>If your absorbance values end up below 0.1 or above 1, consider running the test again, but with a higher/lower OG concentration, respectively.</li>
            <li>If a run is repeated or a quick run is followed up by a full run, make sure to use fresh tips. It is also recommended to clean the channels with EtOH before the next use.</li>
            <li>If you are testing a single-channel head, it makes most sense to just pipette the first row. Make sure to then also only measure the pipetted row(s) on the plate reader.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><b>Please start the script on the robot now! While the robot is running the protocol, please enter your experimental setup in the following steps. Tips on how to measure the plate will follow.</b></p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <div id="instruction_reader">
        <h3>Preparing the plate(s) for measuring the absorbance</h3>
        <p>After pipetting, the content of your plate(s) will not be perfectly mixed. Consider the following points to make sure your reader measurement is as realiable as possible.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a shaker to thoroughly mix the water in the wells with the OG solution.</li>
            <li>Shaking for 1-2 min at 2500 RPM should be sufficient.</li>
            <li>It is highly recommended to seal the plate with aluminium foil or tape to avoid spilling.</li>
            <li>Especially for 384-well plates, it is necessary to spin down the liquid in the wells with a centrifuge. Recommended settings are 3 min at 1500 &times; g.</li>
            <li>Liquid will get stuck on the foil if the plate is not centrifuged before removing it, making the results unreliable.</li>
            <li>Visually inspect the plate to make sure no dust or lint is stuck to the bottom of the wells (on the outside).</li>
            <li>Make sure any foil or lid is removed before putting the plate into the reader.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Measuring the absorbance with the plate reader</h3>
        <p>The following key points should be considered when measuring the absorbance with your plate reader of choice.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure you have the right type of plate selected on the reader.</li>
            <li>The wavelength should be set to 450 nm for measuring OG absorbance.</li>
            <li>Measuring once per well should be sufficient. If you make multiple measurements per well, check the SD in the output file to make sure that the results are consistent for each well.</li>
            <li>If you measure multiple times per well, the mean absorbance for each well will be used for assessing the pipetting performance.</li>
            <li>For some readers, scripts with the appropriate measurement settings are already available.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> If you did not pipette a whole plate, only measure the row(s) you pipetted to avoid problems during data analysis.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Uploading the reader output file(s)</h3>
        <p>If you selected the option, the gravimetric accuracy test will be performed in the next step. Afterwards, the reader files can be uploaded. Please consider the following points before creating the files.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have multiple plates, each one should be saved in a separate file.</li>
            <li>For a list of supported formats, go to the file upload step.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <div id="instruction_gravimetric">
        <h3>Running the gravimetric accuracy test</h3>
        <p>You selected the additional gravimetric accuracy test, which is used to find out if the whole pipetting head (all channels on average) pipette the right volume. If the individual channels give good results in the absorbance test but the gravimetric test is off, there might be a problem with the overall volume pipetted by all channels (the channels pipette too little or too much in general).</p>
        <br>
        <p>This test uses a separate protocol on the robot and only a single plate. The robot should pipette a given amount of water into each well of the plate.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Work quickly to avoid evaporation and enter the weight as precisely as possible.</li>
            <li>For a 96-well plate, use a volume between 50 and 100 μl per well to get meaningful results.</li>
            <li>If the resulting volume per well is a bit lower than expected, that might be normal, especially when working with low volumes.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>General steps:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Measure the weight of the plate before the first round of pipetting.</li>
            <li>After the fist round of pipetting, quickly weigh the plate and enter the new weight.</li>
            <li>Keep the water in the plate and continue with the second round of pipetting.</li>
            <li>Weigh again and enter the second weight measurement.</li>
            <li>Do the same for the third and final measurement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Downloading and interpreting the test results</h3>
        <p>In this step, you can download the HTML report and take a look at your results. If you are not sure how to interpret them, read on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The report starts with an overview of the tested parameters. This should help when comparing reports.</li>
            <li>Then, a brief overview of the results of the test criteria is given with red indicating major problems with the tested head, orange indicating minor problems and green indicating that all test criteria were passed.</li>
            <li><b>This overview does not provide a full picture!</b> Please take a look at the diagrams below as well.</li>
            <li>The graphs and heatmaps below show additional information that might be useful for finding out what the problem is.</li>
            <li>The second page contains the report for the gravimetric test (if it was performed).</li>
            <li>The following pages contain diagrams for the individual plates (if replicates were used).</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>It is always recommended to have a thorough look at all the diagrams. The criteria can be passed even if there is a problem present with one of the channels.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> When testing a single-channel head, please look at the row corresponding to the channel you measured in the plots. If you measured more wells than were pipetted, your results will look wrong, even if they are perfectly fine. Also, column averages will not be displayed correctly. Please ignore them.</p>
        <br>
